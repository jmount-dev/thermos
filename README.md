I want to create a browser application from scratch. I don't want to use Chromium. I want to create a iOS/MacOS client browser that integrates deeply into both the Mac & the iPhone. 

# Features that it should have: 
## Baseline
* Should be very similar to the core function of Arc Browser
* Allow dark mode for all sites
* Widgets
* Deep integration with Perplexity
## Mac Specific
* Run in background
* Full disk access
* Widgets
* Accessibility configuration
* Local network access
* Hide in dock
* Shortcut to prompt new tab 
## iOS Specific
* Control center tools
* Widgets
* Live activities
* App Intents / Shortcut integration
